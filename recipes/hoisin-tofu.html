<p>A mid-week favourite that packs a flavour punch for those days when you want something quick and
    healthy. Don't like pak choi? Swap it for your favourite veg: tenderstem broccoli or sugarsnap 
    peas work well. This vegan stirfry can be whipped up in as little as 20 mins so why not give it a whirl?
</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 spring onions, thinly sliced (green and white parts seperated)</li>
    <li>a thumb sized piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated</li>
    <li>2 tsp chilli paste</li>
    <li>300g pack extra firm tofu, drained and pressed dry in a clean paper towel</li>
    <li>300g straight to wok udon thick noodles</li>
    <li>2 packs of pak choi, sliced into 2cm ribbons</li>
    
</ul>
<h4>For the sauce</h4>
<ul>
    <li>3 tbsp rice wine vinegar </li>
    <li>3 tbsp soy sauce </li>
    <li>4 tbsp soy sauce</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Get everything ready before you start, as it comes together quickly. 
        Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl with 150ml freshly boiled 
        water and set aside.</li>

    <li>Heat the oil in a wok (or deep frying pan) over a high heat. Add the <strong>whites</strong> 
        of the salad onions, ginger, garlic and chilli paste and cook until the 
        fragrance is released, being careful not to let it catch. Using your hands, 
        crumble the tofu into the pan. You may need to tear any larger pieces.</li>

    <li>Stir it all together then stir fry for 4 minutes, scraping the bottom of the 
        pan to mix in any crusty bits. Add the noodles to the pan, gently separating 
        them with your fingers, and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the sauce, mix, then 
        add the sliced pak choi and stir to mix well.</li>

    <li>Lower the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, or until the pak choi is wilted and 
        the sauce has slightly thickened. Serve immediately, topped with the remaining 
        salad onions.</li>
</ol>
<h4><em>Enjoy!</em></h4>
