    <p>This quick and easy chicken curry is creamy, <strong>full</strong> of flavour and takes less than half an hour! 
    You can <em>easily</em> adapt this recipe according to what you have - swap onions for spring onions, or use chicken breasts 
    instead of thighs. You can even add some extra veg if you like!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 spring onions</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>200g chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp curry powder</li>
        <li>1tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>400g/14oz  boneless skinless chicken thigh, 
            cut into 2.5cm/1in pieces</li>
        <li>100ml/3Â½fl oz Greek-style natural yoghurt, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>To serve</h4>
    <ul>200g/7oz long grain rice</ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Thinly slice the spring onions, reserving a handful of the sliced 
            green parts for garnish. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium 
            heat and cook the spring onions and garlic for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, curry powder and ground ginger and cook for 3-4 minutes. 
            If the pan gets dry add a splash of water and make sure the spices don't burn.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook for 5 minutes. Make sure all the chicken is coated 
            and is beginning to brown on the sides.</li>
        <li>Add 250ml/9fl oz water and bring to the boil. Reduce to a medium to low heat and 
            cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through with no sign of pink
             juices in the middle of the pieces.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice. Pour the rice into a saucepan and 
            rinse it under the cold tap to take away any cloudy starch. Drain the cloudy water 
            away. Add clean water for cooking the rice. You need almost twice as much water as rice. 
            (If you use a mug of rice, add a little less than two mugs of water). Bring to the boil 
            then reduce the heat to a low simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and cook very gently for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to 
            stand with the lid on for 10 minutes. This will finish cooking the rice. Keeping the lid 
            on is important, so none of the steam escapes.</li>
        <li>Take the curry off the heat, stir in the yoghurt then season with salt and pepper. 
            Serve the curry with the rice and garnish with a drizzle of yoghurt.</li>
    </ol>
