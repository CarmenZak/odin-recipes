<h1>Sausage, leek and fennel pasta</h1>
<img src="../images/sausage-pasta.jpeg" width="300">
<p>This quick and easy pasta dish is sure to be a family favourite and it's ready in 35 minutes!</p>
<p>Try to buy the best quality sausages you can: I buy ones with a minimum of 90% pork as they have a nicer flavour and less fat. 
You can adjust the recipe by adding chilli flakes instead of fennel and even add some single cream to make an extra
creamy sauce.</p>
<h4><strong>Prep:</strong>10 mins</h4> <h4><strong>Cook:</strong>25 mins</h4>
<h4><strong>Serves:</strong>4</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>6 good quality pork sausages</li>
    <li>3 leeks, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>400g fusilli</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
    <li>1 tsp fennel seeds</li>
    <li>2 tsp wholegrain mustard</li>
    <li>zest of 1 lemon</li>
    <li>grated parmesan to serve</li>
    <li><em>Optional:</em>Add 2 heaped tblsp of creme fraiche</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Break the sausages up into small, bite sized pieces 
        with your hands. Cook over a medium-high heat for 8-10 mins until browned and 
        crispy in places. Remove using a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
    <li>Boil a full kettle. Add the leeks to the pan and season. Cook over a low heat for 10-12 
        mins until softened and just starting to caramelise. Meanwhile, fill a large pan with the 
        boiled water and some salt, and cook the pasta following pack instructions. Drain, reserving 
        150ml of the cooking water.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and fennel seeds to the leeks and cook for 2 mins. Stir through the mustard and 
        sausages, then pour in 100ml of the pasta water and let it bubble for 1 min. If you're using creme 
        fraiche then add that in now and stir briefly until well mixed. Tip in the pasta, 
        sprinkle over the lemon zest and toss everything together, adding a little more pasta water if 
        needed. Divide between plates and top with Parmesan and black pepper before serving.</li>
